# Use start-project

## Context

The Individual Marketplace service line has many codebases that need to be 
created as we reorganize our macro architecture around bounded contexts.

Our service line has a set of architecture decision records that establish 
norms that all the codedbases should adhere to.

Our service line has settled on standard tools to address certain cross-cutting
concerns and to enable cross-context interaction. Starting new codebases from 
scratch, then including and configuring all the standard tools has typically 
taken teams many days at the beginning of projects and has been prone to 
creating unnecessary inconsistencies. Inconsistencies across codebases 
increases the time it takes engineers to become productive when they switch 
between them.

## Decision

We will use the `@mktp/start-project` package to set up this repository 
initially and to add projects to it as needed.

## Status

Accepted

## Alternatives Considered

Set up the projects, tooling, and configuration in this project "by hand."

## Consequences

`start-project` makes it quick and easy to get started on new codebases and 
have them configured to match the macro architecture

## Unresolved

As the service-line-level architectural decisions change, this decision does 
not directly help the team evolve this codebase to keep up.
